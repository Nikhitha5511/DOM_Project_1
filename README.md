## Introduction

In this project, I've showcase how to use JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically change the styling properties of a `div` element. I start with an initial set of styles and then use JavaScript to modify those styles to create an interactive experience.

## Project Details

The project demonstrates the following changes to the `div` element:
- Background color change to yellow.
- Margin set to 20 pixels.
- Padding set to 10 pixels.
- Font size increased to 18 pixels.
- Font weight set to bold.
- Height adjusted to 200 pixels.
- Width modified to 300 pixels.
